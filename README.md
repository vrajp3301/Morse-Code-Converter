# Morse Code Converter

I created this Python script after watching the Independence Day movie, where Morse code was used for communication. The idea struck me to build a Morse code converter in Python.

## Overview

This Python script allows you to convert text to Morse code and vice versa. It contains functions for converting English text to Morse code and for decoding Morse code back to text.
